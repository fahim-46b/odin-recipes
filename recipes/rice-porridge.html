    <p>
      This rice porridge is a delicious Scandinavian-style recipe known in our
      family as "rømmegrøt." You cook rice in milk and butter with crushed
      cardamon seeds for a rich and creamy treat. Mary Beth B. passed down this
      recipe throughout our family. She deserves all the credit for this; we are
      posting it in her name.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        8 whole green cardamom pods, lightly crushed to remove seeds, discarding
        pods
      </li>
      <li>½ gallon whole milk</li>
      <li>1 cup uncooked white rice</li>
      <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Crush cardamom seeds with a rolling pin until very fine; place in a deep
        heavy pan. Add milk, rice, and 1 cup butter; cook over medium heat,
        while slowly stirring, for 90 minutes. Reduce heat if necessary to
        prevent milk from boiling or overheating. Stir in sugar; continue
        cooking until thickens, about 15 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour rice mixture into a serving bowl. Add 3 tablespoons butter on top;
        let melt. Dust with cinnamon. Serve warm or cold.
      </li>
    </ol>
