    <p>
      This apple pie monkey bread layers apple pie filling with cinnamon sugar-coated biscuit dough pieces for a fall-spiced treat. Baked in a Bundt pan and turned out onto a serving plate, this bread is fun to pull apart.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 (16.3 ounce) cans refrigerated biscuit dough</li>
      <li>1 (20 ounce) can apple pie filling</li>
      <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>1/2 cup confectioners sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons milk, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a bundt pan (or a 9x13-inch baking dish if you don’t have one).
      </li>
      <li>
       Open the biscuit cans and cut each biscuit into quarters.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine granulated sugar and cinnamon. Toss biscuit pieces in the mixture until evenly coated.
      </li>
      <li>Pour apple pie filling into a bowl and roughly chop the apples into smaller bite-sized pieces for easier layering.</li>
      <li>Add half of coated biscuit pieces to the prepared pan. Spoon half of apple pie filling over biscuits. Repeat with remaining biscuits and apple filling.</li>
      <li>In a small bowl, stir melted butter and brown sugar together until combined. Pour evenly over the layered biscuits and apples.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are cooked through and golden brown on top, for 35 to 40 minutes. If the top begins to brown too quickly, cover loosely with foil during the last 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Allow monkey bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then carefully invert onto a serving plate.</li>
      <li>For the optional glaze, whisk confectioner’s sugar and milk together until smooth. Drizzle over warm monkey bread before serving.</li>
